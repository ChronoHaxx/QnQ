FC 1 is a solution containing 16.75 g dm–3 of hydrated sodium carbonate, Na2CO3.xH2O.
FC 2 is 0.125 mol dm–3 hydrochloric acid, HCl.

Examiner’s

For

Use

You are required to titrate the sodium carbonate solution with the acid and use your results to
determine the mass of water in the hydrated sodium carbonate.

(a) Pipette  25.0 cm3 of  FC  1 into  a  conical  flask  and  add  a  few  drops  of  the  indicator

provided.

Run FC 2 from the burette until the appropriate colour change for the indicator you are
using is achieved. This is the end-point of the titration.
Record your burette readings in Table 1.1.

Repeat  the  titration  as  many  times  as  you  think  necessary  to  obtain  accurate
results.
Make certain that the recorded results show the precision of your practical work.

Table 1.1 Titration of FC 1 with FC 2

The indicator used in the titration was  …………………………………………… 

Final burette reading / cm3

Initial burette reading / cm3

Volume of FC 2 used / cm3

Summary

25.0 cm3 of FC 1 reacted with ………………. cm3 of FC 2.

Show which results you used to obtain this volume of FC 2 by placing a tick (✓) under the
readings in Table 1.1.

For

Use

(b) Calculate how many moles of the acid were run from the burette into the conical flask

during the titration of FC 1 with FC 2.

(c) Calculate the number of moles of anhydrous sodium carbonate, Na2CO3, in 25.0 cm3 of

FC 1.

Na2CO3 +  2HCl → 2NaCl +  H2O  +  CO2

(d) Calculate the concentration, in mol dm–3, of sodium carbonate, Na2CO3, in FC 1.

(e) Calculate the mass of anhydrous sodium carbonate present in 1.00 dm3 of FC 1.

[Ar: Na, 23.0; C, 12.0; O, 16.0.]

(f) Calculate the mass of water present in the hydrated sodium carbonate.

For

Use

In all tests, the reagent should be added gradually until no further change is observed,
with shaking after each addition.
Record  your  observations  and  the  deductions  you  make  from  them  in  the  spaces
provided.
Your answers should include
•
•

details of colour changes and precipitates formed,
the names of gases evolved and details of the test used to identify each one.

You  should  indicate  clearly  at  what  stage  in  a  test  a  change  occurs,  writing  any
deductions you make alongside the observations on which they are based.

Marks are not given for chemical equations.
No additional or confirmatory tests for ions present should be attempted.

Candidates  are  reminded  that  definite  deductions  may  be  made  from  tests
where there appears to be no reaction.
